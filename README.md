As part of the Go generics discussion I've provided these related generic types that partially follows the generic type patterns in the Go 1 standard library, with the addition of an assertion flag for toggleable error checking. See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23077 for a complete list of standard library types, functions, and methods using this empty interface (interface{}) pattern.
